# Overview

MPC Remote (working title, I guess?) is a non-Play-Store Android app free for personal use. It's not on the Play Store because it doesn't have a file browser. However, if you don't need one, this is free and has no ads.

## Installation

1. On your Android device, go to Settings -> Security.
2. Check "Unknown sources".
3. Get the .apk file (located in the root) onto your device however you choose.
4. Execute the .apk

## MPC Setup

1. If you don't have Media Player Classic, get it from: http://mpc-hc.sourceforge.net/
2. Open the program
3. Go to Options -> Player -> Web Interface
4. Check "Listen on Port"

## Usage

1. Be on the same network as the player (although this can be used through the Internet if you port forward or have a direct connection)
2. Change the IP address to the IP address of the device with MPC set up
3. Click continue
